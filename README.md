This repository provides code to perform [direct amortized neural likelihood ratio estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10571) on a toy neutrino oscillation experiment; the same presented by [Feldman and Cousins](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9711021):

> The toy model is defined by the following parameters: Mesons are assumed to decay to neutrinos uniformly in a region 600 m to 1000 m from the detector. The expected background from conventional $\nu_e$ interactions and misidentified $\nu_\mu$ interactions is assumed to be 100 events in each of 5 energy bins which span the region from 10 to 60 GeV. We assume that the $\nu_\mu$ flux is such that if $P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_e) = 0.01$ averaged over any bin, then that bin would have an expected additional contribution of 100 events due to $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations.
